# 📖 Project Overview  
This project is a **Library Management System** designed not only to implement basic library operations but also to **showcase DevOps practices** for modern application delivery. The system integrates **Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)**, **containerization (Docker)**, and **orchestration (Kubernetes)** to ensure scalability, automation, and consistency across environments.  

The project emphasizes:  
- Infrastructure automation using **Terraform**  
- **Containerization** with Docker for portable deployments  
- **Kubernetes orchestration** for scaling and fault tolerance  
- Reproducible environments for development and production  
- A foundation for **CI/CD pipelines** and automated deployments

# 🎯 Objective  
To build a simple library management system that highlights the **DevOps lifecycle** by integrating IaC, Docker-based containerization, and Kubernetes deployment for scalability, reliability, and maintainability.  

---

# 🔍 Methodology  
The project follows a **DevOps Workflow Lifecycle**:  

1. **Plan & Code** → Develop the application (`app.py`) and define infrastructure with Terraform  
2. **Build** → Package the application into a Docker image for consistent runtime  
3. **Release** → Provision cloud resources using Terraform  
4. **Deploy** → Deploy containerized workloads on Kubernetes  
5. **Operate** → Manage application lifecycle within Kubernetes  
6. **Monitor & Improve** → Extend with logging, monitoring, and scaling strategies
