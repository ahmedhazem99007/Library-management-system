Project Overview

This project focuses on designing and deploying a Library Management System while highlighting DevOps practices such as Infrastructure as Code, containerization, and orchestration. The system is not limited to application logic but demonstrates how modern software is built, deployed, and managed in scalable, automated environments.

The project emphasizes:

Infrastructure automation using Terraform.

Containerization with Docker for portability and consistency.

Kubernetes orchestration for scaling and fault tolerance.

Reproducible environments for seamless development and production.

A foundation for CI/CD pipelines and automated deployments.

🎯 Objective

To implement a simple library management system that showcases the DevOps lifecycle by integrating Infrastructure as Code, containerized application packaging, and Kubernetes-based deployment for scalability and reliability.

🔍 Methodology

The project follows a standard DevOps Workflow Lifecycle:

Plan & Code → Develop application logic (app.py) and define infrastructure with Terraform.

Build → Create container images with Docker for consistent runtime.

Release → Provision cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

Deploy → Deploy containers on Kubernetes for high availability and scalability.

Operate → Manage application lifecycle with Kubernetes.

Monitor & Improve → (Extensible) enable logging, monitoring, and scaling strategies.
